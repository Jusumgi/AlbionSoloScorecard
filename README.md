The Albion Online Solo Player Scorecard is an unofficial way for solo players to track their progress during their daily gameplay.  The thought behind it is that solo players often times feel like they are not making progress because they tend to focus on the more negative experience of getting ganked rather than focusing on what they were able to accomplish before that point.  To combat this, Blackboa and his stream community came up with a number of key performance indicators (KPI) for solo players to give themselves credit for.

I am fairly new to coding and found this to be a great first project to get me out of tutorial hell.

The app currently features Local Storage and a reset button so your stats persist between reloads. I'll be working to get more long-term saving going on so you can view your past accomplishments over time.

Some features I may get around to in no real order..
1.  <s>Make it look good.</s>
2.  <s>Make it more Mobile friendly</s>
3.  <s>Add the Might and Faction Points tracker</s>
5.  <s>Add info bubbles for each KPI to help guide what events they cover</s> Added an About section
6.  ~~Make a reset button~~
7.  Create personal best tracking
8.  Create personal historical stats
9.  Create hotkeys and make use of Electron to make it a desktop app

Thank you for checking this out!
